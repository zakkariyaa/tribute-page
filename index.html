          <h3>He supported the legalization of marijuana.</h3>
          <p>
            Carl Sagan wrote an essay for Time Magazine under a pseudonym outlining the benefits of marijuana. He even
            credited the drug for some of his most profound inspirations in art, science, and music.

          <h3>Bill Nye, the Science Guy, was a former student of Carl Sagan.</h3>
          <p>
            When Bill Nye was a student at Cornell, he took a class with Carl Sagan. Bill Nye remembers the lessons
            fondly, “If you saw the series Cosmos,” he says" “his lectures were like those television shows.

          <h3>There is a unit of measurement named after him.</h3>
          <p>
            Sagan’s “billions of billions” was later (jokingly) turned into a unit. A “Sagan” is defined as a large
            quantity of something, at least four billion.

        <article>
          <h3>On that note, Sagan never really said “billions of billions.”</h3>
          <p>
            While the phrase “billions of billions” became inseparable from Carl Sagan, Johnny Carson was actually the
            first to use the term on a skit on The Tonight Show. The phrase later became associated with Carl Sagan.
